Main screen is an above view of a section of airspace, within the airspace are 4 destination points and an airfield.

Planes enter from the edges of the screen at random.

Each plane has a desired destination; the player needs to direct the plane to its destination by plotting a route for it. The player will need to try to avoid two planes colliding by carefully selecting the route of each plane.

The player will receive points for directing a plane to its desired destination, and will lose points for directing the plane to an incorrect destination. If the player ignores the plane it will continue on the route it entered the playing field on, if it makes it to its required destination the player won’t score, but if the plane exits the map at the wrong point the player will again lose points.

Each plane has different speeds dependant on its type, i.e. a propeller driven aircraft would be slower than a jet aircraft. This means it is necessary for the player to account for aircraft speed when plotting courses for the aircraft.

There will be events occurring which will hinder the player’s performance in game, such as military aircraft which will fly on their own desired routes which the player will have to avoid; or flocks of birds which need to be avoided to prevent bird strikes.

When a plane is directed to the airport it needs to be placed into a holding pattern before it can land. This involves a sub-screen which the user can create a loop track which the plane will follow over the airfield for a fixed period of time before it lands. As more and more planes are trying to land at the airport it becomes more complex keeping the planes separate from each other.

Whilst doing this the user is still required to manage the air traffic in the main window.


An additional mini game that could be a bonus round or an optional extra or incorporated in some other way is a ground controller game. This game is relatively simple compared to the ATC game.

In the mini game the player is tasked with directing aircraft around an airfield, opening and closing gates to allow planes to reach their destination without colliding with one another or colliding with planes on active runways.

The player will have to direct planes down routes to prevent queues building up, if planes can’t exit the runway due to a queue then the player will lose points or a similar penalty. The player will need to attempt to direct traffic whilst preventing collisions and queues, this will get more and more involving and difficult as the player is tasked with more planes.
